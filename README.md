# Genuage 

Genuage is a plateforme for visualizing and analyzing multidimensional point cloud data such those generated from single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). SMLM refers to methods for generating super-resolution microscopy images (PALM, STORM, DNA-PAINT â€¦) and Single particle tracking (SPT) data. 
Genuage accepts all kind of tabular data sets arranged in columns with arbitrary column configuration. 
Genuage is compatible with multidimensional localization data. Visualization features include:
-	2D and 3D point clouds visualization
-	(2D or 3D) + time visualization 
-	(2D or 3D) + molecular orientation visualization
Genuage function in two fully operational modes: a desktop mode and a virtual reality immersive mode. 
Genuage can communicate with Matlab and Python. It includes built in analysis functions and is compatible with user defined Dlls.
Genuage allow image export and generating videos with programable 3D paths and animations.
